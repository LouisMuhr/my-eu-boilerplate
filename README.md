This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, go to your Windows Explorer and create a new Folder, whereever you want it.

Then go to my GitHub and press on the green button "<> Code" and copy the HTTPS link. 
Now go to your newly created folder and click on your path.

Here you can enter the CLI by typing cmd and pressing ENTER.

After opening your CLI, you type "git clone LINK" and enter the HTTPS-Link you just copied and press ENTER. After a few seconds of downloading my repository, just type code . and Visual Studio Code will open itself.
If you made it so far, you have to open another CLI in VSC and navigate to my project folder with and install the needed instances
```bash
cd my-eu-boilerplate
npm install
```


























First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
